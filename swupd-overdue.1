.
.SH "NAME"
\fBswupd\-overdue\fR \- Trigger OS updates if exceeding a time threshold
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBswupd\-overdue\fR [\fIthreshold\fR]
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This program checks that OS updates are applied at boot time if there is an indication that OS updates have not been applied for a specified (threshold) time (in seconds)\.
.
.P
The update is started by signalling \fBsystemd\fR that the \fBswupd\-update\.service\fR should be started, using \fBsystemctl\fR\. This requires that this program is executed with appropriate (\fBroot\fR) permissions in order to succeed\.
.
.P
The \fBthreshold\fR defaults to 14 days, and is checked against the version time stamp file in \fB/usr/share/clear/versionstamp\fR\. If the OS has not been updated longer than the \fBthreshold\fR value, the OS software update service unit will be started\.
.
.P
The \fBthreshold\fR value is in seconds\. It can be passed optionally at the command line as argument 1\.
.
.P
If the \fBswupd\-update\.service\fR unit is masked, the update will fail\. If the \fBswupd\-update\.timer\fR unit is masked, but the \fBswupd\-update\.service\fR is not masked, the update will be performed\.
.
.SH "SYNTAX"
\fBswupd\-overdue\fR is not meant to be directly executed from the command line\. The system administrator should \fBsystemctl enable swupd\-overdue\.service\fR to ensure that the program is run at every boot\. Additionally, one should ensure that OS software updates are automatically applied by enabling \fBswupd\-update\.timer\fR as well\.
.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
On success, 0 is returned, a non\-zero failure code otherwise\.
